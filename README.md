# Performance Monitor #

**WIP**

A Rainmeter skin that shows displays CPU, GPU, and RAM information, as well as graphing framerate in relation to CPU usage, and tracking the minimum framerate for a particular session. The skin can automatically hide when not gaming or performing GPU-related tasks.

## Requirements ##
* [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
* [MSI Afterburner](https://www.msi.com/page/afterburner) (including RTSS)

## Features ##

The following values are tracked:
* CPU Usage
* CPU Temperature
* GPU Usage
* GPU Temperature
* VRAM Usage
* RAM Usage
* Current Framerate
* Minimum Framerate

A graph is shown comparing the framerate with CPU usage, in order to troubleshoot framerate dips.

The skin will automatically disappear when not gaming or performing GPU-related tasks, and will automatically re-appear when otherwise. This behaviour can be disabled via the configuration file.
